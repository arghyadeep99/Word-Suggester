### Word suggestion for each prefix you enter! 

This program will allow you to get word suggestions for words starting with the letters you enter. We have made use of Trie data structure to achieve this. The dataset used here is the [MIT 10000 Words list](http://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000). 

#### Basic Features:
* [x] Print word suggestions for combination of letters provided by user.
* [ ] Ability to change input combination of letters. 
* [ ] Implement GUI for drag and drop down style.
* [ ] Integrate it with Google Assistant to get word suggestions on the go!
